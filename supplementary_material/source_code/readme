Learning to Cartoonize Using White-box Cartoon Representations

This is the source code of our proposed method
Due to the size limitation, training dataset and pre-trained VGG
network cannot be contained here, but we believe that the overall 
structure and each components are clear.

We also include the inference code and the pre-trained model in
'inference_code' folder. Please run 'inference.py' to reproduce some
results shown in the paper and the supplementary material. Note that 
the image resolutions in this code is limited to 720, which may slightly 
differ from the images shown in the paper.

Our method is implemented by tensorflow.
To run the inference code, the following packages are needed:
tensorflow
tqdm
opencv-python
numpy
